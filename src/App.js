/*** CV Form App 
 * Design: idea is to have compnents that are eithr in design or in edit mode. also, i tried to make parent model independant of the structure of their children, for instance, 
 * the Genearl Info section does not have to know which fields in its Adress sub model. 
 * 
 * Implementation: edit mode is quite straight forward AFAICT, for the view mode i have implemented a universal view Util the renders information hirarchy recursevily
